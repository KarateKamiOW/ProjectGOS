Updated Scripts for Project GOS. I don't tend to update this super often since:
1 - This project is not Open Source, (Just showcasing some things for employers)
2- I'm working on this project everyday, so the scripts I upload now are going to be outdated in an hour.
4- Anyways, if you're a potential employer, heyyy. Has anyone told you how great you look today?
