# ProjectGOS


Hello everyone. So, let's hop right into it.
About a year ago I tried my hand at this and well, It's a new day!
New game, new ambitions and a tighter focus, I have a much better idea on how I want the end goal of this game to be. This is what motivates me.
Project GOS is a solo project I've been working on since September 1st, and today I've decided to share the progress I've achieved so far.
Created in Unity using C#, and pixel art, I bring to you all(or few), my first, pre-alpha demo!
Without further ado, let's talk about what the game is about!

Project GOS is a turn based, strategic RPG. You embark on quests, complete levels, and earn rewards that can be used to unlock new spells and items for battles.
Delve in dungeons, unlock new characters to battle with, and battle others online. Yes, Online.
Collect lore pages and learn about the history of the world. Cook meals to sell for money, or eat to boost your health. Fish and mine for resources to upgrade facilities for idle gains.
And of course more that will slowly be revealed in time. Quite ambitious, but I'm happy to say I have a lot accomplished so far. So let's talk about what's in the demo, and whats coming next.

Demo Build 1
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Build 1 only contains 1 level without sound. Lighting and sprites will continue to improve over time. 
Dialog between player and NPCs are available. Dialog choices are available, however for the tutorial level, will remain relatively limited.
Only 1 character. (More are done and ready, I just need to make a character select menu).
Interactable environment. (Including bushes, boulders and torches.)
Short Quests! Quests are in the game and ready! However, short quests will not show up in the player quest log, so for Demo 1, the quest log is irrelevant.
Short Quests NPCs appear on certain maps outside of the base town map. Accepting their quest will reveal their quest progress above their head, as opposed to within your quest log.
This is because regular quest log quests will be placed here, while short quests reset upon leaving the level.
Inventory system with consuming items and discarding items. Consuming items currently has no effect, but will be enabled in future builds. For now, I didn't want to overload players with information with a game that is only 10-20 minutes or so long.
Cooking! You can cook food in the demo! I've worked 3 days straight implementing this feature. This one is fun.
Spell selection. You may not be able to select your characters just yet, but you CAN select the spells you use. All available spells will be unlocked in Demo 1.
There may be a few more I missed, but this covers the main portion of the demo.

So what's coming in the near future?
Storage System! - A very important feature. Currently working on its UI.
Character Select - Obviously also very important. Should be done by the next build.
In Battle Spell Descriptions - While in battle, an image displaying the casted spells information should be revealed. This has already been added, but is temporarily shut off due to a lot of UI changes that made it look out of place.
The Town. Also already done; some NPCs just need to be given their functionality.
More Spells!
Relics. (Items that give characters a secondary passive effect)

What's coming Later


PVP. (Soooo cool news! I actually have player v player working. The UI needs to be tidied up, and the timers between games need to be slightly better synced, otherwise this may be a feature I add sooner rather than later.)
Mining and Fishing. (Sprites done, just need coding)
DailyEvents.

Anywaysss, I'm thinking about posting an update every other week or so; maybe a new build a month, leading up to the game's release?
Not sure yet.
Making this game has been a fun challenge.  From the coding, to the artwork(The Indie staple, Pixel Art of course), to the sound, animations, story and dialog... I do it all baby!
For now this game will be PC only, but overtime, if reception is well, I may port it over to phones.


Finally, for those looking to play the game, simply run the 'Build1.1' exe. in the builds folder. Once the game starts, click, 'Begin', input a username at the top(At least 3 letters), click Enter and enjoy!

Any questions, advice, feedback, or perhaps you found a bug (I know of a few), don't be afraid to email me at - Assante.waldron@gmail.com
See you next Update!
